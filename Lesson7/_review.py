# (1) What is the difference between a for loop and a while loop?

# (2) Which type of loop would I use to...
#    - accept user input until they enter 'quit'? while
#    - print every item in a list?
#    - choose random playing cards until I draw a spade?
#    - ask the user what they want to eat for lunch every day of the week?

# (3) Which numbers will be printed?
i = 0
while i < 10:   # 10 < 10
    print(i)    # print 5
    i = i + 5   # change i from 5 to 10
