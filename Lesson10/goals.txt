Last week, we...
    1) validated user input (allow only up, down, left, or right), and
    2) stopped wall collisions
    3) tell the user when they are next to walls BEFORE they move, and
    4) add our choose-a-door and guess-the-password puzzles to our mazes.

Today, we will...
    1) Choose an escape room theme, and modify our code to support the theme.
    2) Add a new feature to our code.
