ArachnoPhonics

The computer will choose a random word to be the mystery word. The number of
letters in the word should be represented to the player. The player will have to
guess a hidden mystery word by guessing each letter, one at a time. If they
guess the letter wrong, they will lose a life and part of a spider will appear.
If the player makes a correct guess, that letter will appear in the proper place
of the hidden word. Allow the player to continue the game until the spider is
fully drawn and the player is out of attempts. The game should end if the player
guesses the hidden word before the spider is drawn.
